ReadmissionAnalyzer
=======================
We propose a computerized system and design for clinical monitoring of patients for the risk of readmission. Our online cross-platform system is deployed completely on the cloud and accessible from any device with an internet connection and web browser application. We integrate electronic patient records from multiple sources and data streams such as ADT and CDA messages using a standardized schema capable of storing relevant fields to compute the risk of readmission using the widely used LACE index therefore
supporting further predictive big data analytics and the infrastructure for machine learning techniques, while using HIPAA and P-HIPA compliant data structures and techniques. Using our enterprise data warehouse, effective visualization applications can be rapidly prototyped on the structured data to analyse the status of readmissions as time-series or geographic clusters.
